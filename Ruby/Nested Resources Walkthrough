Last time out I had a lot of questions on how to add comments to posts
Most broadly, this is an issue called 'nested resources'

This will be a quick and dirty example of simply adding comments to a generic blog

Work in an existing application or new one:


This is assuming you have an app with your models set up, in this case, Article

Generate the Comment model
rails g model comment commenter:string body:text article:references
This creates a model and migration for a comment which has a commenter that identifies who is commenting, a body for the actual comment, 
and an article that it will reference
In your models, add your associations

> class Comment < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :article
  end 
 Comments will belong to posts
  
> class Article < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :comments
  end
Articles will have many comments
This is a one-to-many relationship

Migrate your DB

In your routes.rb 
update your posts routes to be 
> resources :articles do
    resources :comments
  end

Generate a comments controller
> rails g controller Comments

Edit your articles show to have the comment form inside

// in articles/show.html.erb
    <h2>Add a comment:</h2>
    <%= form_with(model: [ @article, @article.comments.build], local: true) do |form| %>
	<p>
		<%= form.label :commenter %><br>
		<%= form.text_field :commenter %>
	</p>
	<p>
		<%= form.label :body %><br>
		<%= form.text_area :body %>
	</p>
	<p>
		<%= form.submit %>
	</p>

    <% end %>

Now the comment controller needs to be built out. Start with the create action to make a new comment
>   def create 
		@article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
		@comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)
		redirect_to article_path(@article)		
	end

	private 

	def comment_params
		params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)
	end
    
Edit the articles show again to also display the comments
// in articles/show.html.erb

> <h2>Comments</h2>
    <% @article.comments.each do |comment| %>
	<p>
		<strong>Commenter:</strong>
		<%= comment.commenter %>
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Comment:</strong>
		<%= comment.body %>
	</p>
    ----------
    <% end %>
    

Give it a shot
