Last time out I had a lot of questions on how to add comments to posts
Most broadly, this is an issue called 'nested resources'

This will be a quick and dirty example of simply adding comments to a generic blog

Work in an existing application or new one:


This is assuming you have an app with your models set up, in this case, Post

Generate the Comment model
rails g model comment commenter:string body:text post_id:integer
This creates a model and migration for a comment which has a commenter that identifies who is commenting, a body for the actual comment, 
and a post_id that identifies the post it will be attached to

In your models, add your associations

> class Comment < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :post
  end 
 Comments will belong to posts
  
> class Post < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :comments
  end
Posts will have many comments
This is a one-to-many relationship

In your routes.rb 
update your posts routes to be 
> resources :posts do
    resources :comments
  end
