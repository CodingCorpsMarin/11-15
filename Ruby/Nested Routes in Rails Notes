Competencies 
Rails has very powerful routing mechanisms
By now, we should be familiar with 'resources'
Nested resources come into play when you have models with associations
Nested resources mean nested routes, this is illustrated in the routes.rb, written in a similar fashion to 
nested loops/conditionals
The actual path looks like articles/:article_id/comments/[action]


Applications
Implement nested routes/resources in Rails applications



Resources:

Note - it is not @article = Article.find(params[:id]), it is actually @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
